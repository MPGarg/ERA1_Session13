## Code Details

All classes & functions are defined in [link](https://github.com/MPGarg/ERA1_Session13). 

In notebook ERA1_S13.ipynb [link](ERA1_S13.ipynb) functions from the main repository are called. YOLOV3 is trainined using PyTorch-Lightning.

Model was trained for 40 epochs using OneCycle Scheduler. 

**Accuracy for model:**
Class accuracy is: 78.290955%
No obj accuracy is: 97.919060%
Obj accuracy is: 65.142708%
